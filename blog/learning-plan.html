            What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            My long-term goal is to find a job as a full stack software developer. After graduating from Dev Academy, I hope to find an entry-level position or internship opportunity at a large company to start my career as a developer.

            What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp? 
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            I believe that my strengths identified in Sprint 2, such as honesty, forgiveness, humility, and prudence, will be helpful for teamwork during Bootcamp. However, my shyness and communication limitations may hinder my ability to work effectively with others. I hope that with more practice and as I become more familiar with my classmates, these hindrances will ease.

            What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            I believe that my biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be how to get familiar with my classmates and communicate with them effectively. When facing unfamiliar people, I tend to feel shy and hesitate to initiate conversations, resulting in more passive communication. This may give my classmates the wrong impression that I am cold and difficult to approach, and in turn become a barrier to effective communication. Additionally, English is my second language, which is also one of the obstacles.

      <div class="question">
        <li>
          <p>
            What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? 
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, this could be communication, teamwork within groups, pairing with others, giving and receiving feedback, developing some leadership skills, or improving your self-awareness and reflective skills. 
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            Apart from the leadership skills, I hope to develop and improve all the other skills mentioned above.

            What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team? 
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            My expectations from the Bootcamp team are to help me understand myself better. During the Bootcamp, I hope to become more familiar with the team and receive guidance in identifying my strengths and limitations. I have a tendency to be overly humble and often struggle to acknowledge my achievements. Additionally, I tend to avoid exposing my weaknesses and am not always courageous enough to face them. This can result in a lack of clarity in recognizing my own limitations. Therefore, I would appreciate encouragement and assistance in recognizing both my strengths and weaknesses.

            What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp

          <p class="answer">
            Reach out to peers and facilitators directly for help.  
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            I plan to prioritize and efficiently plan my tasks, avoiding procrastination and managing my time effectively. If unexpected events occur that interrupt my schedule, I will communicate with my team promptly and work to minimize any impact on other team members.

          <p>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</p>
          <p class="answer">My limitations in terms of learning include my ability to communicate with others and my lack of initiative in independent learning. This has mainly affected my learning by not proactively seeking help from classmates or teachers when I encounter difficulties, which reduces the likelihood of receiving assistance 
            from them. Additionally, my limited capacity for independent learning may restrict the scope of what I can learn. </p>

            resources available to me. I am committed to seeking help in a timely way and not 
              waiting until it is too late. </p>
          <p class="answer">I expect the facilitation team to provide clear guidance, constructive feedback, and a safe and supportive learning environment. I will also try
