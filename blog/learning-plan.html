          <p>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</p>

        <li>
          <p>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</p>
          <p class="answer">My limitations in terms of learning include my ability to communicate with others and my lack of initiative in independent learning. This has mainly affected my learning by not proactively seeking help from classmates or teachers when I encounter difficulties, which reduces the likelihood of receiving assistance 
            from them. Additionally, my limited capacity for independent learning may restrict the scope of what I can learn. </p>

        <li>
          <p>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed 
            in yourself while at Dev Academy? </p>
            <p class="answer">I would like to develop a few soft skills, including communication, 
              collaboration, time management, and emotional intelligence. </p>
        </li>
      </div>
      <div class="question 4">
        <li>
          <p>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include: 
  
            An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives 
            
            What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you </p>
          <p class="answer">
            I am committed to managing my workload in this programme by prioritizing my tasks, setting realistic goals, and staying organized. I will work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators, and industry/community 
            representatives by communicating effectively, respecting diversity and inclusivity, and maintaining a positive attitude.   
          </p>
          <p class="answer">When things start to get overwhelming, I will take a step back, re-evaluate my priorities, and seek support from my peers, facilitators, or other 
            resources available to me. I am committed to seeking help in a timely way and not 
              waiting until it is too late. </p>
          <p class="answer">I expect the facilitation team to provide clear guidance, constructive feedback, and a safe and supportive learning environment. I will also try 
                my best to communicate my needs and concerns to the facilitation team in a 
                respectful and timely manner. </p>
                <p class="answer">Currently, I know that my block-out times will be for rainy day daycare drop-offs and pick-ups. However, if other commitments or events come up, I will plan ahead to avoid any conflicts with my programme. </p>
