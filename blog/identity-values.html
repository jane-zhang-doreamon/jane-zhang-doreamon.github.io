    <h1>Identity & Values</h1>
    <ol>
      <div class="question 1">
        <li >
          <p>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed 
            up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now. </p>
            <p class="answer">During my accounting studies, a classmate asked me to do his assignment in exchange for money. He wanted 
              to avoid failing the course and achieve good grades. However, I made the ethical decision to refuse his 
              offer. I believed that honesty and integrity were more important than the monetary gain. Even today, I still 
              stand by my decision and believe that ethical values should always be upheld, even in challenging situations. </p>
        </li>
      </div>
      <div class="question 2">
        <li>
          <p>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity. </p>
          <p class="answer">I grew up in a traditional Chinese family, and under the influence of this culture, I have become a hardworking and humble person. My grandfather has had the biggest impact on me among my family members. He taught 
            me through his own actions to respect others, to be kind, honest, and to work hard in my studies and career. </p>
        </li>
      </div>
      <div class="question 3">
        <li >
          <p>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey. 
  
            My strengths identified as honesty, forgiveness, humility, prudence and teamwork. 
            
            I believe that honesty is crucial in coding as it involves working complex systems and
             code that must function correctly. Being honest in acknowledging mistakes and 
            taking responsibility for them can lead to effective problem-solving and a better quality of code.  </p>

            I believe that honesty is crucial in coding as it involves working complex systems and code that must function correctly. Being honest in acknowledging 
            mistakes and taking responsibility for them can lead to effective problem-solving and a better quality of code.</p>
          <p class="answer">Fairness and forgiveness can help me work better in a team and collaborate with others. When working on projects with others, it's important to treat everyone fairly, listen to their opinions, and be open to feedback. Forgiveness also plays an important role in team dynamics, as it helps
             to maintain positive working relationships and allows for mistakes to be learned from rather than punished. </p>
          <p class="answer">Humility can help me to be more receptive to feedback and willing to learn from others. The coding field is
             constantly evolving, and being humble allows me to stay open to new ideas and approaches. </p>
          <p class="answer">Prudence is essential in coding as it requires planning, foresight, and attention to detail. 
            Careful and prudent coding can help prevent errors and ensure the functionality of the code. </p>
          <p class="answer">Lastly, teamwork is crucial in the coding field. Collaborating with others can help to identify 
            problems early on, develop innovative solutions, and enhance the overall quality of the code. </p>
          <p class="answer">Overall, I believe my strengths in honesty, fairness, forgiveness, humility, prudence, and teamwork can be valuable assets in 
            my coding studies and career, allowing me to work effectively with others and produce high-quality code. </p>

      <div class="question 4">
        <li>
          <p>Evaluate your limitations in 
            terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey? </p>
          <p class="answer">My limitations in terms of learning and career development include my ability to communicate with others and my lack of initiative in independent learning. This has mainly affected my learning by not proactively seeking help from classmates or teachers when I encounter difficulties, which reduces the likelihood of receiving assistance 
            from them. Additionally, my limited capacity for independent learning may restrict the scope of what I can learn. </p>
        </li>
      </div>
      <div class="question 5">
        <li>
          <p>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance 
            or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the 
            time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</p>
          <p class="answer">When I encounter resistance or tension, my first step is to communicate with my colleagues. 
            I am honest about my feelings and try to find a solution together. I also make sure to clearly express
             my expectations and offer support if needed. This approach helps to 
            foster open and honest communication, which ultimately leads to more effective teamwork and problem-solving.</p>
