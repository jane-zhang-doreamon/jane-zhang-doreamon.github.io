    <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>
        Research has shown that understanding the principles of neuroplasticity can benefit people in numerous ways. For example, it can help people 
        recover from brain injuries, improve cognitive function, manage mental health conditions, and promote healthy aging. By engaging with the 
        principles of neuroplasticity, individuals can take steps to promote brain health and function. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for my benefit, there are several things I can do. For example, I can engage in activities
         that challenge my brain, such as learning something new. I can also engage in physical exercise, which has been shown to promote 
         neuroplasticity. Additionally, I can engage in activities that promote relaxation and reduce stress, as stress can have negative 
         effects on neuroplasticity. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some of ways that can help increase my neuroplasticity: 
        <ul>
          <li>
            Keep learning. Continuously learning new things is a great way to keep my brain active and adaptable. Make an effort to learn 
            something new every day. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Engage in physical activity. Exercise is not only good for my physical health but also for my brain. Regular physical activity, 
            such as running, can promote the growth of new brain cells and help improve cognitive function. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Practice meditation. Meditation has been shown to have a positive impact on the brain, promoting neuroplasticity and reducing stress. 
            Meditating every day, even if it's just for a few minutes. 
          </li>
        </ul>

    <h1>Growth Mindset</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>
        Growth mindset describes a way of viewing challenges and setbacks. People who have a growth mindset believe that even if they struggle with 
        certain skills, their abilities aren't set in stone. They think that with work, their skills can improve over time.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The power of "not yet" surprised me. Believing that you can improve is even more powerful than I had initially thought. 
        I have decided to cultivate a growth mindset in my studies and in my personal life moving forward. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I am going to embrace any challenges that arise on my learning journey and maintaining a positive thinking when faced with setbacks. 
        I will accept mistakes and failures as a natural part of the learning process and actively seek out opportunities to improve by asking 
        for help and feedback.  
      </p>

    <h1>Blend with my learning plan and strategies</h1>
    <div class="question">
      <p>
        Reflecting on my understanding of neuroplasticity and growth mindset, I have come to the realization that I tend to have a fixed mindset, 
        where perfection is the ultimate goal. However, I now understand that this mindset can limit my learning potential and hinder my progress. 
        Therefore, I have decided to shift my mindset towards a growth mindset, where I believe that I can improve with hard work and dedication. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, I have learned that needing help and asking for it is not a sign of weakness. Instead, it is an opportunity to collaborate 
        with others and create solutions to the challenges I face. Therefore, I plan to ask for help more often and actively seek out learning 
        opportunities where I can work with others to deepen my understanding. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, my understanding of neuroplasticity and growth mindset has encouraged me to embrace challenges, stay curious, 
        practice regularly, seek feedback, and stay motivated in my learning journey. I believe that by adopting these strategies 
        and shifting my mindset towards growth, I can maximize my learning potential and achieve my goals.
