        <p>What is Emotional Intelligence?</p>
        <p class="answer">
          Emotional intelligence (EI) refers to the ability to recognize, understand, and manage one's own emotions, 
          as well as the emotions of others. It involves being aware of and in control of your emotions, being able to communicate effectively, 
          and being empathetic towards others. 
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          Emotional intelligence is often broken down into four main components: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management.  
          <strong>Self-awareness</strong>  involves recognizing your own emotions and how they affect your thoughts and behavior.  
          <strong>Self-management</strong>  involves being able to regulate your emotions and behaviors in response to different situations.  
          <strong>Social awareness</strong>  involves understanding the emotions of others and being able to pick up on social cues.  
          <strong>Relationship management</strong>  involves using emotional intelligence to navigate social situations and build and maintain positive relationships with others.

        <p>How is EQ different to IQ?</p>
        <p class="answer">
          IQ measures a person's cognitive abilities, such as their problem-solving skills, logical reasoning, and mathematical abilities. 
          It is a measure of a person's intellectual potential and is often used as an indicator of academic and career success. 
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          EQ, on the other hand, measures a person's emotional intelligence, which includes their ability to understand and manage their 
          own emotions, recognize and empathize with the emotions of others, and maintain healthy relationships. 
          EQ is often considered as an indicator of a person's social and emotional competence.

        <p>Why is EQ important?</p>
        <p class="answer">
          Emotional intelligence allows us to better understand and express our emotions, as well as read and respond to the emotions of others. 
          This leads to clearer and more effective communication, both in personal and professional settings. It also benefits us in our 
          interpersonal relationships. Additionally, EQ plays a significant role in our decision-making process. People with high EQ are 
          better able to manage their emotions when facing difficulties, making better decisions by not letting negative emotions dominate their 
          choices.
