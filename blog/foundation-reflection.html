            What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning? 
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            I have learned three new things about myself and my ego. Firstly, I tend to have a fixed mindset in most situations. 
            Secondly, my emotional intelligence has not been well developed. And thirdly, my level of self-awareness is relatively low. 
            The good news is that I have now recognized these issues and I know that all of them can be improved through training and 
            practice.

            What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming? 
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            Values, empathy, and self-awareness all play important roles in learning and programming.Â 
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            <strong>Values</strong> are the guiding principles that shape our beliefs, decisions, and actions. In programming, having a strong set of values such as integrity, accountability, and teamwork can help individuals to approach problems with an ethical and collaborative mindset. Additionally, values can help programmers prioritize tasks, set goals, and make decisions that align with their personal and professional goals. 
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            <strong>Empathy</strong> is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. In programming, empathy can help developers to create user-centered solutions that meet the needs of the users. When programmers are able to empathize with the end-users, they can better understand the user's perspective and create software that is intuitive, easy to use, and efficient. 
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            <strong>Self-awareness</strong> is the ability to reflect on one's own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. In programming, self-awareness is important because it can help programmers identify their own strengths and weaknesses. By understanding their own limitations, programmers can seek out opportunities for improvement and growth. Additionally, self-awareness can help programmers to manage their emotions, work well with others, and communicate effectively.

            What has surprised you the most about the core learning? 
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            The most surprising thing is that I learned that many aspects of myself are not predetermined and can be developed through training. Prior to the core learning, I had always believed that I was a certain type of person with certain personality flaws, especially in social situations, that could not be changed. Through the core course, I have come to understand concepts such as neuroplasticity, growth mindset, and emotional intelligence, and realized that they can be trained and developed. I can improve myself through training in these areas.

          <p>
            What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning? 
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            The most challenging aspect of core learning for me has been writing reflections and participating in listening and looping practices. I believe that these tasks are difficult for me because I am not yet proficient in them, and I acknowledge that I need more practice to improve.

      <div class="question">
        <li>
          <p>
            Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course? 
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            We often work on group projects and interact with peers and facilitators, and these interactions require effective communication and collaboration skills. And I believe that people who possess these skills are more likely to work well with others, be successful in group projects, and ultimately thrive in a professional web development environment. Overall, the focus on core learning would significantly enhance our ability to succeed in our career.

            Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer. 
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            I don't think learning core learning is a waste of time. I think it is an important and helpful part for me. We are not programming machines, we are human beings, who need to work together with other developers to complete a project. Therefore, soft skills are just as important as coding skills.
