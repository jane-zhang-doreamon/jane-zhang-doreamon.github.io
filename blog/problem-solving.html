          <p>were blocked on a simple problem: </p>
          <p class="answer">
            During the coding tests on variables and arrays, I encountered a simple problem where I couldn't get all the green ticks. 
            To solve the issue, I utilized two problem-solving techniques: the Rubber Duck method and reading error messages. After 
            going through the code and error messages, I discovered that I had mistakenly typed "tane" instead of "Tane", which was the 
            expected value. Throughout the process, I remained focused on resolving the problem and passing the test, so I didn't experience 
            any strong emotions. However, the experience taught me the importance of paying attention to details. I realized that overlooking 
            even the smallest errors can cause significant issues in coding, and I need to be more mindful of my work to prevent similar 
            mistakes in the future.

          <p class="answer">
            When I was working on the deBee problem, I was unable to remove all the buzzes from my code. After reading the 
            error message, I realized it was a case sensitivity issue with "buzz". That's when I thought of using the toLowerCase/toUpperCase 
            methods. I applied toLowerCase directly on the converted array, but it still didn't work. This time, it removed buzz/Buzz/BuZZ 
            successfully, but also turned other uppercase letters into lowercase ones. Challenge failed. Then I stopped and used the rubber 
            duck method to organize my thoughts and found the correct position for the toLowerCase method. Finally, deBee was successfully 
            solved.

        <li>
          <p>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes: </p>
          <p class="answer">
            I rarely use <strong>Pseudocode</strong>, as I prefer to organize my thoughts in my head and start coding directly. However, 
            after encountering some problems, I realized that writing down my ideas with Pseudocode can help me clarify my thoughts.
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            "<strong>Trying something</strong>" is a technique I frequently use. When I learn a new method, I would try to apply it to the current test and 
            write some code to see if it works. 
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            The <strong>Rubber ducky method</strong> is a common and confident technique for me. Whenever I encounter small errors or 
            difficulty in my thought process, I chat with the rubber duck and usually find a solution. 
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            I also use the <strong>reading error message</strong> technique often, with a 70% to 80% confidence rate, as sometimes I 
            don't fully understand the error message.
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            I frequently use <strong>console.log</strong>, with an 80% confidence rate, to check if the code I wrote produces the expected result. 
            If not, I modify it.
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            <strong>Googling</strong> is a method that I am 90% confident in using, and it is a helpful tool for me to solve problems.
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            I am only 30% confident in <strong>asking for help</strong>, as I am usually too shy to do so. However, after having a 1v1 meeting with a 
            facilitator to solve some of my questions, I gained a bit of confidence and felt encouraged to ask for help 
            more bravely in the future.
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            <strong>Improving the process with reflection</strong> is a technique that I am 60% confident in. Previously, I used to write code, 
            pass the test, and finish. I hardly ever reviewed my code. However, after the JavaScript Kata exercise, I started to 
            review my code, even if all the tests passed. I checked to see if I remembered why I wrote certain things and if I could 
            simplify my code.

        <li>
          <p>
            Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. 
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            There was a time when I was very hesitant to ask for help. It happened during sprint 2 when I was working on the JavaScript 
            Intro exercises. I needed to run the "npm install" command in the terminal, but instead, I accidentally typed "nmp install" 
            which obviously wouldn't give me the expected result. I repeated this mistake three times, and I realized I needed help from 
            my peers on Discord. However, I hesitated and ultimately decided not to ask for help. 
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            The main reason why I was reluctant to ask for help is that I thought my question was stupid and I didn't want others to 
            see me asking stupid questions. I believe the root cause of this reluctance comes from my past experiences of being ridiculed 
            for asking "stupid" questions. Teachers and peers would often say things like "It's a simple question, you shouldn't be 
            asking that." These experiences have made me hesitant to put "asking for help" on my list of problem-solving methods.
